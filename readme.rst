griffins
========

Introduction
------------

Griffins are program that are able to apply conversion, transformation or identification on binary files.

Griffin, batch and inner process
--------------------------------

- An inner process is specific execution to apply on a file; like `magick convert -auto-orient test.jpg test.jpg`. Here we want to rotate a picture `test.jpg`.
- A batch is a collection of process or command to execute (like the previous one).
- A griffin is a execution of one or several batches.

Status
------

-  `OK` with exit code 0. It means that every thing goes well.
-  `ERROR` with exit code 1. It means that the griffins, the batch or the inner process stop abruptly.
-  `WARNING` with exit code 2. It means that something goes wrong on the griffins, batch or the inner process.

Action
------

- `ANALYZE` like check if a picture is corrupted or not.
- `IDENTIFY` like identify the file, and find it's PUID.
- `GENERATE` like generate a GIF from a JPG picture.
- `EXTRACT` like extract some EXIF data from a picture.

Analyze result
--------------

- `VALID_ALL` means that the file is the right format and is not corrupted.
- `NOT_VALID` means that the file is the right format but may be corrupted.
- `WRONG_FORMAT` means that the file is in the wrong format.

Parameters
----------

Parameters are the required variables in order to run a batch in agriffin serialized in a JSON file named `parameters.json`:
- `requestId` of type string, is the vitam request id.
- `id` of typestring, is the batch id.
- `debug` og type boolean, show or not the following thing in `result.json` file: `result`, `error`,`executed`.
- `actions` of type list of object, is the list of action to do on an input. An action is compose of the following:
    * `type` of type string, is one of the following: `ANALYZE`,`IDENTIFY`, `GENERATE`, `EXTRACT`.
    * `values` of type object, containing the necessary values to run the action.
- `inputs` of type list of object, is the list of file to process, an input is compose of:
    * `name` of type string, is the name of the input.
    * `formatId` of type string, is the puid of the input.

Result
------

Result of the griffin execution is set in a JSON file named `result.json` with the following information:
- `requestId` of type string, is the vitam request id.
- `id` of type string, is the batch id.
- `outputs` of type list of object, representing the list of results. The output is compose withe the following variables:
    * `result` (show only in `debug` mode) of type string, is the log result of th execution (for example the `stdout` of a command).
    * `error` (show only in `debug` mode) of type string, is the log error of th execution (for example the `stderr` of a command).
    * `executed` (show only in `debug` mode) of type string, is what thing has been executed (for example a command and itâ€™s arguments).
    * `input` of type input, is the input received.
    * `outputName` of type string, is the name of the output file, result of the action.
    * `status` of type string, is the status of the execution, one of `OK`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`
    * `analyseResult` (show only in `ANALYZE`) of type string, one of `VALID_ALL`, `NOT_VALID`, `WRONG_FORMAT`.
    * `action` of type string, is the action executed, one of `ANALYZE`, `IDENTIFY`, `GENERATE`, `EXTRACT`.

Input files
-----------

Input files are set in a directory named `input-files`.

Output files
------------

Output files are set in a directory named `output-files`.

Example
-------

Here `f5a5f253-04a5-4567-b88a-c5af7df633df` is the batch id.
- `./imagemagick-griffin-vitam/f5a5f253-04a5-4567-b88a-c5af7df633df/parameters.json` is the file where all parameters are set.
- `./imagemagick-griffin-vitam/f5a5f253-04a5-4567-b88a-c5af7df633df/result.json` is the file where processing results are set.
- `./imagemagick-griffin-vitam/f5a5f253-04a5-4567-b88a-c5af7df633df/input-files/` is the directory where files to process are set.
- `./imagemagick-griffin-vitam/f5a5f253-04a5-4567-b88a-c5af7df633df/output-files/` is the directory where processed files are set.
